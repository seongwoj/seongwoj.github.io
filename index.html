    <p>My name is Alex Jeong. I'm originally from South Korea, but grew up in San Jose. I majored in Accounting at University of Southern California. After graduating, I worked at a public accounting firm, Ernst & Young, for two and a half years. I decided to leave my job in order to pursue my interest in coding.</p>
